    nostro "I have not had company for so long, [name]. You must forgive me for rambling on."

    nostro "The point is: I have, of late, conceived of a concept for a novel I am quite passionate about."

    nostro "A story of star-crossed lovers - a perfectly normal boy and a cannibal girl, who loves him but desires to consume him whole."

    nostro "The story is unique, however, by way of its audience. I hope to write for children in the teen ages, who perhaps believe in their love but are not yet so world-weary."

    nostro "This is my manuscript. I had this meeting scene completely planned out, but I'm afraid it has all gone a tad wrong."

    mc "That idea seems... a bit ahead of its time."

    nostro "Oh, believe me, I understand that it may right well be."

    nostro "But I've an odd feeling that the idea itself will be revolutionary in a hundred years or so."

    nostro "Ah, not that I will be around to see it succeed by that point. Like other mortals, that is not within my lifespan, of course."

    nostro "But it is a nice thought, is it not?"

    nostro "The essential bit of the story, you see, lacks an artistic touch to bring it to life. The meeting of the main lovers."

    nostro "They meet in a university, and the boy falls in love at first sight, while the girl struggles to tamp down her flesh-eating tendencies."

    nostro "Whenever I hope to write the way that he describes her, the words seem to fail me completely. I can neither make head nor tail of it."

    mc "I know the feeling."

    nostro "I knew you would."

    nostro "'If only I could call on [name],' I thought to myself, 'the conundrum could certainly be addressed.'"

        nostro "Er, sorry, but I am not really certain how that phrase is helpful in this scenario."

    nostro "Oh, but that is brilliant!"

    nostro "It carries just the right touch of sentimentality for the scene. Of course, the specific adjectives must be transposed, but that conveys just what I would like it to."

    nostro "Oh, I almost feel motivated to uncork one of my vintages. It sounds foolish, but you would be shocked by how long I have been pondering this singular scene."

    nostro "In fact, perhaps an offering would be appropriate. I have troubled you to come visit me, have I not?"

    nostro "I amm sure a deity like you can appreciate a good wine."

    mc "Perhaps. I've never had wine, actually."

    mc "But I'm not here for any sort of reward, Nostro. It's very kind of you, but really not necessary."

    nostro "What?"

    nostro "That is simply unacceptable!"

    nostro "Why, {ink}a god who has never had wine is like a king who has never seen gold!{/ink}"

    nostro "That simply will not do."

    "Nostro whisks two glasses from a nearby cabinet, then two wine bottles. He slides a glass toward me. Uncorking both, he pours with practiced dexterity."
    
    "Such hospitality. Are mortals all so kind?"

    "When I pick up my glass, he clinks his against mine. The liquid inside swirls, the crimson drink in his cup far more opaque. I bring the glass to my lips."

    nostro "You see, there is yet another plot point I worry about the composition of."

    nostro "At the most climactic moment of the narrative, I hope for an antagonistic cannibal to hunt the boy. However, with the way my manuscript has developed, he has already crept into hiding."

    nostro "He is quite protected while in hiding, but I require that he ventures outside so that he may be captured, and only then can the novel progress."

    nostro "I could always rewrite the preceding scenes, but I really would rather not if it can be avoided."

    nostro "I can see that you are a god for a reason, Inksmith."

    nostro "That's all of the notable obstacles to completing this piece addressed, then. And at long last, I can spy the end of my journey."

    nostro "Well, I claim that it has been long, but I suppose greater authors than I have languished much longer on their writing. I can only aspire to one day be inducted into their ranks."
