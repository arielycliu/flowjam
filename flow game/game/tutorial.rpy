    You are ready. Should you prove yourself worthy, and cement yourself in the hearts of your devoted, you you will enter into the pantheon.

    I have great faith in you, name.


    I shall leave you with one last teaching: the world of mortals 

    I shall leave you with one last yeaching, then.

    The world of mortals is constrained by the bounds of time, but we are not.



    The world of mrotals is constrained by time. It marches onward, relentless, and always in the same everlasting line.

    But gods such as us do not live that way.

    We exist instead in the moments - the  times of need, where a prayer is made in our name.

    As such, it may be wise to create points which you can return to, should you wish. 



    above bookmark quote

    try it now mechanic

    Perfect. 


    Remember: should you wish to save the spirit of inspiration



    ok how about you say the first bit

    a What was all that training for if you are going to teach name the important bits now?

    elias oh, eliza. one day, you will understand. sometimes, the best things are simply to be saved for last/






    Your ink lends you the power to save words of your followers for inspiration. Any of them.

    But do not squander it; your power comes only from your followers, and as a fledgling god, you have them in short supply.

    Spend your energy wisely, and you may attract more yet.

    Go on, then. I wish you all the best.
